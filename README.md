## why

inspired in part by [a hackernews discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21332957) about personal knowledgebases.

## how

**adding pages:**
See [the contributing section](./contributing/).

**reading pages:**
You can read the pages locally, using your favorite editor/markdown renderer, or you can navigate to the Github page, and let Github render everything for you!

(It turns out trying to bend jekyll themes into behaving like wikis is harder than expected. Ideally, we would be using a GitBook, but those are expensive, and we're cheapskates.)
